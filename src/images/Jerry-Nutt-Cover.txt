Dear CVS Health,
  
  I am responding to your position for Certified Pharmacy Technician.
  
  I have been working in the customer service field for my entire adult life. I believe I more than excede the desired qualifications for this position.
  I will have no issue providing caring service that exceed the customer's expectations and satisfy all registration, licensing and certifications required.
  If you believe I may be a good fit for this position, I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, Jerry.
